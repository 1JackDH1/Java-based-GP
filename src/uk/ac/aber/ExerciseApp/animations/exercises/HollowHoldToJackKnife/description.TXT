1. Get into a hollow hold position: Lie on your back and extend your arms above your head. Engage your core, lift your legs and upper body off the floor, and hold them there.
2. Add in a jack knife: Crunch up, bringing your arms overhead toward your toes and your legs toward the centre of your body.
3. Slowly release back to the jack knife position and repeat.
