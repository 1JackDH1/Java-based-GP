1. Get into a high plank position, with your hands stacked underneath your shoulders and your feet close together.
2. Keeping your core engaged and your hands and feet stationary, pike your hips up and back into the Downward Dog pose. Your body should form a triangle with the ground. Keep your neck neutral. Your gaze should be directed toward your feet.
3. Hold here for a second, then return to the plank. Repeat.
